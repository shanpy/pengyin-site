<blockquote>
<p>Only investments with a positive NPV should be considered</p>
</blockquote>
<h2 id="capm-capital-asset-pricing-model">CAPM (Capital Asset Pricing Model)</h2>
<h3 id="usage">Usage</h3>
<p>determine an <strong>appropriate rate</strong> when making NPV calculations.</p>
<h3 id="calculation">Calculation</h3>
<p><code>r = rf + β(rm – rf)</code></p>
<ul>
<li><code>r</code> = Discount rate</li>
<li><code>rf</code> = Risk-free rate of return - Return Rate that can be received with a risk-free investment like <strong>U.S Treasury Bills</strong></li>
<li><code>rm</code> = Market rate of return - Return Rate that can be received by investing in a diversified portfolio (S&amp;P 500)</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="_1">β</h3>
<p>Beta of the Investment - a measurement of the risk of an investment compared to the risk of the market as a whole.</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><code>β&gt;1</code>: Investment has <strong>more risk</strong> than the market. Example: For an investment with a β = 1.29, a 1% increase in the market means a 1.29% increase in the investment value.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><code>0&lt;β&lt;1</code>: Investment will tend to move in the <strong>same direction</strong> as the market. The asset is <strong>not as sensitive</strong> to market movements. Example: For an investment with a β = .75, a 1% increase in the market means a .75% increase in the investment value.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><code>β=0</code>: The investment is <strong>not correlated</strong> with the market. <em>“Risk-free” assets have β of 0.</em></p>
</li>
</ul>
