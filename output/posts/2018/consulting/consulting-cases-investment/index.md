##NPV (Net Present Value)

>Only investments with a positive NPV should be considered

##CAPM (Capital Asset Pricing Model)

###Usage

determine an **appropriate rate** when making NPV calculations.

###Calculation

`r = rf + β(rm – rf)`

- `r` = Discount rate
- `rf` = Risk-free rate of return - Return Rate that can be received with a risk-free investment like **U.S Treasury Bills**
- `rm` = Market rate of return - Return Rate that can be received by investing in a diversified portfolio (S&P 500)

###β

Beta of the Investment - a measurement of the risk of an investment compared to the risk of the market as a whole.

- `β>1`: Investment has **more risk** than the market. Example: For an investment with a β = 1.29, a 1% increase in the market means a 1.29% increase in the investment value.

- `0<β<1`: Investment will tend to move in the **same direction** as the market. The asset is **not as sensitive** to market movements. Example: For an investment with a β = .75, a 1% increase in the market means a .75% increase in the investment value.

- `β=0`: The investment is **not correlated** with the market. *“Risk-free” assets have β of 0.*
