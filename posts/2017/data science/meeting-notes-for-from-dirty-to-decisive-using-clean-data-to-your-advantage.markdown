.. description: I attended USGWeb 2017 and found the presentation 'From Dirty to Decisive: Using Clean Data to Your Advantage', presented by Mr. Johann Lohrmann being very useful for opening my mind of starting projects with massive data sets, so I wrote this post as a record of his presentation.

#Solution for Making Decision based on Large Set of Data

##How Data Impacts Decision

###Two Kinds of People in Decision Making Process

1. `Liability`: people who know materials well, but not involved in decision making process
2. `Assets`: people who can access materials and impact on decision making process

###Ignore Data Scraps and Less Hunting

>Need clear actions: Less Time Hunting Data, More Time Getting Actions

##The Decision Making Modal

>Stream Line

###Decision

>A choice or determination made after considering a set of presented materials

###Supported Materials

1. `Road Map` before decision
2. `Guidance` for decision

###Modals

1. `Informed-ness`
2. `Timeless`: decision-desired actions (time for taking action) => Risk Impact Analysis
3. `Completeness`: degree that I am confident in my decision
4. `Preparation of Direct Action`: streaming triggered actions
5. `Optimality of Outcome`: degree to which decision gets best result. This is the *environment* for best decision

##The Decision Making Process

###Step 1: Decision-Driven Decision Making

>Always start from decision

####What do we want to achieve?

1. <del>What DATA can I access?</del> 
2. `Problem-Solve-Targeted`: We want to have our data **available to subscribers**. 

###Step 2: Find answers to questions

1. Know questions `before see the data`
2. i.e. *What will answer my questions?*
3. Draw three panels: ![three panels](/images/2017/data-science/three-panels.png)

###Step 3: Clean it up

####Process in place before cleaning

>Goal: Get to decision point

1. Build Process
2. Make data run under this process
3. Example: Get Excel File => Data Visualization => Find Rules to Clean File =>Get Cleaned File

####How to clean data?

1. `Capture`: what **bring** attention? => Based on rules (*error*)
2. `Clarify`: what it mean in **context** (process) => looking for **data connector points/common points**
3. `Organize`: data with **highest priority** first
4. `Reflect`: **review data** frequently => *Ask client questions*. Note context may change
5. `Engage`: **implementation** with data

###Step 4: Present

>Target to the right stakeholder, right time, right way

Remember different people use data differently, so when present data to clients, remember to use data that client only cares.

###Step 5: Distribute the insights

Apply `insights` to decision making process: Turn Data into Action

####Three Panels for Evaluating Action

###Examples and Conclusions

data.geogria.gov

####Composition of Data

1. Based on decision I want to make
2. Bring historical data in
3. Ask questions: what **cause** the gap? What's the **impact** of gap?

###Tools Recommendation

1. `CSV`s
2. `OpenRefine`
3. `SQL`
4. `DKAN`
5. `Data Integration List`: share with client/standard for clean data. Example: null data? misspelling?
6. Majority of time spending on **clean data** => *put this in SOW! show price in SOW!*
